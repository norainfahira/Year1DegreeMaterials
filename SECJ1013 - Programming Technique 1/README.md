## SECJ1013 - Programming Technique 1
This course is basically an intro to "thinking like a coder" using C++. It’s all about learning how to break down a problem and solve it step-by-step by writing your own programs. You’ll start with the basics like variables and input/output, then move into the logic side of things like "if" statements and loops. As it gets more advanced, you'll learn how to organize your code with functions and arrays, and even dive into trickier stuff like pointers, file handling, and structs. By the end, you’ll be able to build actual software that solves real-world problems from scratch.
